# CanvasLMS-Redirect-Project

This project is a "shiny" thing I want to do to make it easy to add links into a Canvas LMS assignment or Quiz, and have it work from year to year.  An example of what I'm trying to do is put a link to a cisco Networking class, whick will have a diffrent class code from year to year, but is found in the URL.  I want to have a system where it's easy to link to say, a PHP script, that would take a URL with a text parameter, and switch to a hardcodes one from a data file, and redirect to the new actual URL.  
Examples to follow:
